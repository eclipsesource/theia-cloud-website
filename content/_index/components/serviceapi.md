Theia.cloud does not make assumptions about the UX of your developer journey.
Instead, Theia.cloud is usually integrated into an existing web UI, e.g. your developer portal.
To enable this, Theia.cloud provides an easy-to-use Service API for running applications in a session, as well as for retrieving and managing existing sessions of a user.
