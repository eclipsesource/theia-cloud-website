Theia Cloud is a framework to build a hosting service for Theia-based applications, IDEs and tools.
This enables you to provide users of your Theia-based application access to instances of it via the browser.
The instances will be hosted on a Kubernetes cluster.
Theia Cloud will manage the orchestration of this, including creating containers per user, managing access to them.
To achieve this, Theia Cloud is based on latest and evolving blueprints and best practices distilled from long-term industry experience in hosting cloud-based tools and IDEs.
